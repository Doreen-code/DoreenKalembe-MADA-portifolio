Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in.

The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the results folder.\nIt’s the same code done 3 times:\n\nFirst, there is an R script that you can run which does all the computations.\nSecond, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script.\nThird, my current favorite, is a Quarto file with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run.\n\nThe last version has the advantage of having code in one place for easy writing/debugging, and then being able to pull the code into the Quarto file for a nice combination of text/commentary and code.\nEach way of doing this is a reasonable approach, pick whichever one you prefer or makes the most sense for your setup. Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

There are 1817 males and 2196 females. Out of the 4434 individuals, 45.3% are male and 54.7% are female. The distributions and percentage proportions of the variables are shown in the table.\nLets make some visualisations for the data that we have and also explore some some relationships between some variables\n\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = GLUCOSE, y = BMI, color = as.factor(DIABETES))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter plot of Glucose vs BMI\", x = \"Glucose\", y = \"BMI\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationships.\n\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = as.factor(DIABETES), y = GLUCOSE, fill = as.factor(SEX))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Glucose Levels by Diabetes Outcome\", x = \"Diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\", y = \"Glucose\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also visualize the distributions of continuous variables.\n\n# Histogram of total cholestral\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = TOTCHOL)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"chloestral level Distribution\", x = \"Cholestral levels\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Histogram of systolic blood pressure\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = SYSBP)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"yellow\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"systolic blood pressure distribution\", x = \"sysBP\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Density plot for BMI\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = BMI)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"BMI Density Plot\", x = \"BMI\", y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above curves, we see that BMI, total cholestral and systolic blood pressure are normally distributed. This part was contributed by Annalise Cramer\nHere’s the prompt I gave ChatGGPT:\nI want you to give me R code to create a dataset called diab_data with 4013 observations. There should be seven variables, SEX, AGE, BMI, TOTALCHOL, SYSBP, DIABETES, and GLUCOSE. SEX is binary with 1 or 2 as outcomes, mean 1.547, where 45.3% are male and 54.7% are female. AGE has a range of 32-70, with a mean of 49.98 and a median of 49. BMI has a range of 15.54-56.80. with a mean of 25.85 and a median of 25.45. TOTALCHOL has a range of 113.0-696.0, with a mean of 237.3 and a median of 234.0. SYSBP has a range of 83.5-295.0, with a mean of 133.0 and a median of 129.0. DIABETES is a binary variable with either 0 or 1, mean of 0.2866. GLUCOSE has a range of 40.00-394.00, with a mean of 82.14 and a median of 78.00. Only individuals with DIABETES=1 should have a GLUCOSE value about 120. TOTALCHOL should follow a roughly normal distribution with mean 220 and standard deviation 55. SYSBP should follow a Poisson distribution. BMI should follow a normal distribution. Do you have any questions?\nChatGPT asked the following clarifying questions:\nA few clarifications before generating the dataset:\n1.) SEX: You specified that 45.3% are male and 54.7% are female, with a mean of 1.547. This means I’ll set 1 = male, 2 = female and ensure the proportions match. 2.) AGE: Should I assume a normal distribution centered around 49.98 with an appropriate standard deviation to achieve the given median and range? 3.) BMI: You mentioned it should follow a normal distribution, but you provided only the mean (25.85) and median (25.45). Do you have a standard deviation in mind, or should I estimate one based on a plausible distribution? 4.) TOTALCHOL: You stated it should be normally distributed with a mean of 220 and SD of 55, but your overall dataset statistics suggest a mean of 237.3. Should I adjust it to 237.3 or stick to 220? 5.) SYSBP: You mentioned a Poisson distribution but gave a mean of 133. Do you want λ = 133 for the Poisson distribution, or should I adjust it to match the range and median? 6.) DIABETES: I’ll generate this as a Bernoulli variable with a mean of 0.2866. 7.) GLUCOSE: You mentioned that only diabetic individuals should have GLUCOSE values above 120. Should I model GLUCOSE differently for diabetics (e.g., a normal distribution centered above 120) and non-diabetics (e.g., normal distribution centered around 82.14)? Let me know how you’d like me to handle these details!\nI responded to these questions with the following:\n1.) Yes that’s good. 2.) Yes, assume a normal distribution with the parameters I gave you. 3.) For BMI use a standard deviation of 4.086135. 4.) Use 237.3. 5.) Adjust to match the range and median. It look like a poisson or a left skewed normal distribution. 6.) Okay good. 7.) No, do not model them as separate normal distributions.

Let’s see how it ohld up when I make the plots.\n\nggplot(diab_original, aes(x = GLUCOSE, y = BMI, color = as.factor(DIABETES))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter plot of Glucose vs BMI\", x = \"Glucose\", y = \"BMI\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = GLUCOSE, y = BMI, color = as.factor(DIABETES))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter plot of Glucose vs BMI\", x = \"Glucose\", y = \"BMI\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese don’t match great. I don’t think the synthetic data does a good job of matching the distribution of the glucose. I specified that it should be normal and the means.\nLet’s try the next plots.\n\nggplot(diab_original, aes(x = as.factor(DIABETES), y = GLUCOSE, fill = as.factor(SEX))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Glucose Levels by Diabetes Outcome\", x = \"Diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\", y = \"Glucose\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = as.factor(DIABETES), y = GLUCOSE, fill = as.factor(SEX))) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Glucose Levels by Diabetes Outcome\", x = \"Diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\", y = \"Glucose\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-diabetic data matches pretty well, t=but the diabetic data has much higher glucose. I think this is the same problem as in the previous plots, where the distribution is wrong.\n\n# Histogram of total cholestral\nggplot(diab_original, aes(x = TOTCHOL)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"chloestral level Distribution\", x = \"Cholestral levels\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = TOTALCHOL)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"chloestral level Distribution\", x = \"Cholestral levels\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Histogram of systolic blood pressure\nggplot(diab_original, aes(x = SYSBP)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"yellow\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"systolic blood pressure distribution\", x = \"sysBP\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = SYSBP)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"yellow\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"systolic blood pressure distribution\", x = \"sysBP\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Density plot for BMI\nggplot(diab_original, aes(x = BMI)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"BMI Density Plot\", x = \"BMI\", y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(diab_data, aes(x = BMI)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"BMI Density Plot\", x = \"BMI\", y = \"Density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese don’t look half bad. They look wider, but when comparing the x-axes, these aren’t too far off. Notably, the high value outliers aren’t present. The distirbutions are shaped correctly, even the tricky left skew. However, the sythetic data has a problem with over representing the lowest values."

I kept changing a few things manually till when i finally landed on what i wanted and when i realised that it is close to what i want, i had to do simple more touches and then conclude with it.\nComing to the tables, I did a feed it an ai prompt. “help me make an interactive table with these characteristics. I listed the characteristics that i wanted.” It produced the first lines of code but my data set was a little messed and hence it needed some cleaning. I went back into the code and removed some observation, recategorised the data then made some summary statistics."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nWarning: package 'here' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/kkdor/Desktop/GitHub_Work/DoreenKalembe-MADA-portifolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Those should look as nice, polished and easy to understand as possible."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R.

The data contains 15 observations and five variables. I added two more variables that is eye color which is a character variable and waist size which is a numeric variable showing the waist size of each individual plus their individual eye color. ## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis.\nTo cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here dataanalysis_template_references.bib) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:\nExamples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in (McKay, Ebell, Billings, et al., 2020; McKay, Ebell, Dale, Shen, & Handel, 2020)"
