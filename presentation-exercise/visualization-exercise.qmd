I started by looking for the data on th fivethirtyeight page.

"I asked AI to help me reproduce the image.

"Ai prompt" Can you reproduce for me this image using this data set. I fed it with the data set but unfortunately, i think the Ai i am using doesnt read the data set or i dont know how to do it well. 

it gave me few prompts which i have fully written down in my quarto file of the presentations. 
I kept changing a few things manually till when i finally landed on what i wanted and when i realised that it is close to what i want, i had to do simple  more touches and then conclude with it.


Coming to the tables, I did a fed it an ai prompt. 
"help me make an interactive table with these characteristics. 
I listed the characteristics that i wanted. " It produced the first lines of code but my data set was a little messed and hence it needed some cleaning. I went back into the code and removed some observation, recategorised the data then made some summary statistics.
